# IPD project configuration

This directory contains files for configuring this IPD project:

    cmake/ - build system setup

    README.md - this file

    lib/ - included libraries

        catch/ - testing framework

        ge211/ - game engine library

    share/ - other files we need to stash somewhere

You probably shouldnâ€™t change anything here. Since the course staff
might change it at will, you should be prepared for merge conflicts.
